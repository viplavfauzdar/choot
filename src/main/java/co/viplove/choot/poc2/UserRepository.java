    // The UserRepository interface extends Neo4jRepository, allowing for CRUD operations on User entities.
    // It includes a method to find a User by their username.
    // The repository is annotated with @Repository, indicating that it is a Spring Data repository.
    // This interface will be implemented by Spring Data at runtime, providing the necessary methods for interacting with the database.
    // The User entity is identified by its username, which is marked with the @Id annotation in the User class.
    // The UserRepository interface is part of the co.viplove.choot.poc2 package, which is a separate package from the Person and PersonRepository classes.
    // This separation may indicate a different domain or functionality within the application.
    // Overall, the UserRepository provides a way to manage User entities in a Neo4j database.
    // The use of Spring Data simplifies the implementation of data access layers, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.
    // The repository pattern is a common approach in software development, promoting separation of concerns and making it easier to manage data access.
    // By extending Neo4jRepository, the UserRepository inherits a variety of methods for interacting with the database, such as saving, deleting, and finding User entities.
    // The findByUsername method is a custom query method that allows for retrieving a User by their username, enhancing the functionality of the repository.
    // Overall, the UserRepository interface is a key component in the data access layer of the application, facilitating interaction with User entities in the Neo4j database.
    // The use of Optional<User> as the return type for findByUsername indicates that the method may return a User or may not find a matching User, promoting safer handling of null values.
    // This approach aligns with best practices in Java development, encouraging developers to consider the possibility of absent values.
    // In summary, the UserRepository interface is an essential part of the application's architecture, providing a clean and efficient way to manage User entities in a Neo4j database.
    // Its design leverages the power of Spring Data, making it easier to implement data access logic while adhering to established software design principles.
    // The separation of the UserRepository from other repositories, such as PersonRepository, suggests a modular approach to application design,
